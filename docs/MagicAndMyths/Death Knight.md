Requiring further sacrifices and rituals to fuel your ascendance.


## Mechanics

Melee Combat focused, raises dead units as undead, requires strong will to control all the undead, eventually becoming a fully fledged death knight granting total immunity to mental breaks, and losing any passions.


Requires will to subdue the unruly dead, when at or below the required will level all undead will obey without question, if you go over 20% over your will capacity, undead will start to turn feral until you are back under the limit, these feral undead will attack anyone, you must kill and reassert control.
