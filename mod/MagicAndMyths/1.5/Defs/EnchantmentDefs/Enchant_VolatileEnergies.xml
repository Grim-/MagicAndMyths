    <label>Enchantment of Volatile Energies</label>
    <description>A dangerous arcane formula developed by vindictive battle-mages. This enchantment surrounds the bearer with unstable energies that violently rebound upon attackers. When struck, these energies flare with brilliant purple light, sending a portion of the force back to its source. Even successful attackers find themselves unexpectedly wounded by their own blows.</description>
